		<h2>{0}</h2>
		<p>
			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b>.
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{8}</b>, <b>{9}</b> and <b>{10}</b> forms
			3 (regional) strong links or conjugate pairs. The 1st set of <i>bridge</i> cells
			<b>{3}</b> and <b>{4}</b> share <b>{11}</b>, with the 2nd set of
			<i>bridge</i> cells <b>{5}</b> and <b>{6}</b> sharing <b>{12}</b>.
			The 3 strong links are joined therefore with these 2 weak links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can be removed from any cells sharing
			a row, column or block with both <i>start and end</i> cells <b>{2}</b> and <b>{7}</b>.
		</p>

			This technique is similar to a 2x2x2 Finned Swordfish technique logic, Coloring
			technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques
			which is in itself a subgroup of Alternate Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques.
