		<h2>{0}</h2>
		<p>
			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b>.
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{8}</b>, <b>{9}</b> and <b>{10}</b> forms
			3 strong links (conjugate pairs). The 1st set of <i>bridge</i> cells
			<b>{3}</b> and <b>{4}</b> share the same region <b>({11})</b>,
			therefore forming a weak link. The 2nd set of <i>bridge</i> cells
			<b>{5}</b> and <b>{6}</b> share the same region <b>({12})</b> which
			means that they also form a weak link. The 3 strong links therfore
			are joined with these weak links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be
			removed from any cells sharing a row, column or block
			with both <i>start</i> cells <b>{2}</b> and <b>{7}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is similar to a 2x2x2 Finned Sashimi Swordfish technique logic.
