	<h2>WXYZ-Wing {11}{9}{10}</h2>
		<p>
			The four cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b>
			form a <i>double-linked</i> <b>WXYZ-Wing</b>: The three cells
			<b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, and <b>{2}</b> form an almost locked set
			linked to the bivalue cell <b>{3}</b> through <i>both</i> values
			<b>{4}</b> and <b>{8}</b>.
			Regardless of the final value of cell <b>{3}</b>, the double-link
			would force the other 3 cells from the pattern to have different
			values to that one. The 4 different values will be in 4 cells
			therefore forming a locked set.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><u>Other occurrences of any of the values</u></b> of the Wing
			pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row,
			column or block with all Wing cells containing that value.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest cell of the wing has {9} candidtaes and all 4 cells of
			the WXYZ-Wing pattern have a total of {10} candidates.
