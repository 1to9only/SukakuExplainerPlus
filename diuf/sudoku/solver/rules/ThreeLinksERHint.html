		<h2>{0}</h2>
		<p>
			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b> and <b>Empty Rectangles</b>.
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{8}</b>, <b>{9}</b> and <b>{10}</b> forms
			3 strong links through conjugate pairs (Arrow) or a special arrangement
			of cells in a block called <i>Empty rectangle</i> (Yellow). These
			strong links are weakly linked to each other via <b>{11}</b> and <b>{12}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be
			removed from any cells sharing a row, column or block
			with both <i>start and end</i> cells of the strong link pattern.
			If an Empty rectangle is at the start or end of the pattern then
			the removable occurences of the value <b>{1}</b> would be from
			cells sharing a row or column with cells of the block with value
			<b>{1}</b> that are not part of <b>{11}</b> or <b>{12}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is similar to a Finned Swordfish technique logic.
