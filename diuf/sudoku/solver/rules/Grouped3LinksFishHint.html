			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b> that infer a strong link
			and/or a special arrangement of values in a line or block also known as
			<b>Grouped Strong Links</b> (where a strong link is inferred from a groups of
			values).
		</p>
		<p>
			the arrangement of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{8}</b>, <b>{9}</b> and <b>{10}</b>
			form strong links (conjugate pairs, shown as green values) or grouped strong
			links (yellow cell background). These strong links are weakly linked to each other via
			<b>{11}</b> and <b>{12}</b> (Red or Green outlined region).
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be removed from
			any cells sharing a row, column or block with <u><i>ALL</i></u> cells with
			value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{8}</b> and <b>{10}</b> that are not part of <b>{11}</b> or <b>{12}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is part of more genralized technique called X- chains which in itself
			is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). 
		</p>
		<p>			
			This technique uses logic closely realted to Finned Swordfish technique logic.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are
			arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as
			"Empty rectangle".
		</p>
		<p>			
			The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in
			any region can be spotted when a an "Empty mini Area (EmA)" is observed. This EmA
			could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a row, column or block. In the case of "Empty
			rectangle" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as
			"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)".
