  <h2>{2}</h2>
  <p>
   The <b1>{0}</b1> <u>Must</u> have a cell with <g><b>value {1}</b></g> in the solution.
</p>
  <p>
   <r>Other occurrences of <g><b>value {1}</b></g></r> outside the <b1>{0}</b1> which
   share region/regions with <b><u>all cells</u></b> with <g><b>value {1}</b></g> in <b1>{0}</b1>
   can be safely eliminated. This technique covers pointing & claiming and can be thought of as a
   Generalized intersections technique that suits variant regions specifically.
