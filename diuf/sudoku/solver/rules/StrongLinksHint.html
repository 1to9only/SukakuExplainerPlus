		<h2>{0}</h2>
		<p>
			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b>.
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> forms
			{4} (regional) strong links or conjugate pairs. {5} sets of <i>bridge</i> cells
			in <b>{6}</b> and <b>{7}</b>. The {4} strong links are joined therefore with
			these {5} <i>weak</i> links.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can be removed from any cells sharing
			a row, column or block with <i>both start and end</i> cells <b>{8}</b> and <b>{9}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is similar to a 2x2x2 Finned {10} technique logic, Coloring
			technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques
			which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques.
