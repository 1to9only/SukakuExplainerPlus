	<h2>VWXYZ-Wing {12}{10}{11}</h2>
		<p>
			The five cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3}</b> and 
			<b>{4}</b> form a <i>double-linked</i> <b>VWXYZ-Wing</b>: The four 
			cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> form an almost 
			locked set linked to the bivalue cell <b>{4}</b> through <i>both</i> 
			values <b>{5}</b> and <b>{9}</b>. Regardless of the final value of cell 
			<b>{4}</b>, the double-link would force the other 4 cells from the 
			pattern to have different values to that one. The 5 different values 
			will be in 5 cells therefore forming a locked set.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><u>Other occurrences of any of the values</u></b> of the Wing
			pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row,
			column or block with all Wing cells containing that value.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest cell of the wing has {10} candidates and all 4 cells of
			the ALS have a total of {11} candidates.
