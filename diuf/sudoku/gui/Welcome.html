  <h2>Welcome to the <b>{0}</b></h2>
  <p>
  This application can solve a Sudoku, Sukaku (Pencilmark Sudoku) and a number of their
  variants step by step, and explain at each step the technique that is used. It also allows
  you to get <i>all</i> the techniques that can be applied at any step of the solving process,
  and to explain and apply any of them.
  </p><p>
  To enter the Sudoku\Sukaku puzzle, select a cell with the arrow keys or by clicking on it. Then
  type the value, or click on one of the possible values. Press the spacebar or click
  again to clear the cell. Hold the Ctrl-key while clicking to toggle a
  candidate of an empty cell.
  </p><p>
  The following buttons are available:
  <ul>
   <li><b>Check validity</b> to check whether the entered Sudoku is a valid one and has a
    unique solution.
   <li><b>Solve step</b> to get the simplest hint that allows you to perform the next
    solving step. A detailed explanation of the solving technique will be displayed in this area.
    Click again to apply the hint that is shown, and to get the next solving step. To solve
    a Sudoku, just click this button multiple times until the Sudoku is fully solved.
   <li><b>Get next hint</b>: After <b>Solve step</b>, you can use it to get another hint
    without applying the one that is shown. Click multiple times to get more hints.
    Hints are sorted in increasing order of difficulty.
   <li><b>Apply hint</b> to apply the current hint, without getting the next one. It is
    possible to select multiple hints and to use this button to apply all of them at once.
   <li><b>Get all hints</b> to get all simple hints that can be applied on the current situation.
    The hints are grouped by category, and sorted in increasing order of difficulty. The hints
    appear in the right pane. You can select any hint to get a detailed explanation of it,
    and click on <b>Apply hint</b> to apply it.
   <li><b>Undo step</b> Go back one step.
  </ul>
  </p><p>
  The following variants are available (Some of them can be combined):
  <ul>
   <li><b>Latin Square</b>: Also known as QWH, LQ or LS. Removing the blocks will leave only the rows
   and columns as constraints. Sudoku can therefore be considered a subset of Latin Square.
   <li><b>Disjoint Groups</b>: Adds 9 block position groups. In combination with Sudoku it is also known
   as SudokuDG, SudokuP or Sudoku4D.
   <li><b>Windows</b>: Adds 4 Extra Blocks (Windows) as constraints. These would force the creation of 5
   other hidden groups which can be used to help advancing the solution. In combination with Sudoku it
   is also known as Windoku, Hyper Sudoku or SudokuW.
   <li><b>X diagonals</b>: Adds 2 main diagonals as constraints (No repeating symbols in a main diagonal).
   With sudoku it also called SudokuX.
   <li><b>Asterisk</b>: Adds a 9 cell <i>Asterisk</i> Extra group.
   <li><b>Center Dot</b>: Adds a 9 cell <i>Center Dot</i> Extra group.
   <li><b>Girandola</b>: Adds a 9 cell <i>Girandola</i> Extra group.
  </ul>
